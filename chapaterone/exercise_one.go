/*
Getting input from the user and converting it
to something meaningful is one of the fundamental
pieces of programming. Software developers are
always
turning data into information that can be
used to make
decisions. That data may come from the keyboard,
a mouse,
a touch, a swipe, or even a game controller.
The computer
has to react to it, process it, and do something
useful. The exercises in this chapter will help you get
acquainted with how to get input from the user and process
it to produce output. You’ll build up strings, do a little
math, and get your feet wet with the programming language
you’re using. They’re simple problems, but they’ll help you
build up your confidence as a programmer; the problems in the
later chapters of the book are more complex. Each exercise has
additional challenges you can do if you feel up to the task. If
you’re new to programming, some of the challenges will ask you
to use techniques you might not be familiar with yet. Feel free
to skip them; you can always come back and do those challenges
later. Ready? Set? Go!
